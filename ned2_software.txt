hey still around we appreciate your
0:03
patience and dedication get ready for
0:05
net2's software abilities in three two
0:09
one
0:12
the robot's functionalities can be
0:14
greatly expanded with the use of our
0:16
proprietary app near your studio from
0:19
this interface you can connect to the
0:21
robot check its Hardware statuses create
0:23
different workspaces for your projects
0:25
and also use different accessories to
0:27
connect to the robot you have different
0:29
options first of which is the hotspot
0:32
mode then you can also choose to use the
0:35
Wi-Fi mode and finally if you're more
0:37
comfortable with a simple ethernet
0:39
connection you can also do that once
0:41
you've chosen your preferred method you
0:43
should be prompted to calibrate the
0:45
robot you'll find two different tabs in
0:47
near your studio which allow you to use
0:49
the vision set and the conveyor belt
0:51
with the vision set you can create
0:53
different workspaces and change the
0:55
camera's parameters for the conveyor
0:57
belt you can change its speed as well as
0:59
the direction of motion net 2 runs onto
1:02
Ros for Robot Operating System and uses
1:06
a mix of ready-made packages and of our
1:08
own packages our entire raw stack is
1:11
available on GitHub now feel free to
1:13
have a look at it and try to understand
1:15
what's really going on the motion
1:17
planning package we use is movement and
1:19
more specifically we use the KDL
1:21
kinematics plugin feel free to try
1:24
implementing another motion planning
1:26
package or creating your own we love to
1:29
see what you can come up with
1:31
a wide variety of programming languages
1:33
is available with net2 first up is block
1:36
you can access the blockly interface
1:38
directly from nerio Studio don't be
1:41
fooled by its ease of use you can
1:43
actually do quite a bit with it most of
1:44
you will probably be using python we've
1:47
developed not one but two python apis
1:50
that you can use to send commands to the
1:52
room all these apis come with a wide
1:56
range of examples and tutorials to show
1:58
you everything that's possible with the
2:00
room for Automation and control theory
2:03
Matlab may be your way to go well you're
2:06
in luck because we provide support for
2:08
that too from Matlab you can interface
2:10
with the robot to either simulate its
2:13
movements or control it directly if
2:15
you're better off with an Arduino
2:17
controller you're all set to you can
2:19
easily plug in your Arduino board into
2:21
the Raspberry Pi that's running inside
2:23
the robot and control the robot from a
2:26
distance with your Arduino control a
2:28
modbus TCP server is also constantly
2:31
running on the roof this means you can
2:33
easily plug in the net2 into an already
2:35
existing network of plcs and computer
2:38
which use the modbus TCP communication
2:41
protocol finally you can virtually use
2:43
any programming language you'd like
2:45
since the net2 is constantly running the
2:48
TCP ipser all you have to do is make a
2:51
language specific client that transforms
2:54
your commands into Json command packets
2:56
which the robot can improve you'll find
2:59
a tutorial online on how to do so this
3:01
means I'll view C plus and Java fans are
3:04
all set too if you'd like to run your
3:06
code directly from the net2's hardware
3:08
you can always use the python Ross
3:11
wrapper which lets you run Python
3:13
scripts on the robot without going
3:15
through the hassle of using Ross topics
3:17
and services
3:18
well that wraps up our presentation
3:21
video of the net tube I hope you found
3:23
all the information you were looking for
3:24
and chances are any questions you may
3:27
still have will be answered on our
3:29
documentation online so don't hesitate
3:32
to have a look at and in any case our
3:34
support team will be glad to help you
3:36
out if need be thanks for watching our
3:38
